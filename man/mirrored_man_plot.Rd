\arguments{
\item{data}{A tab-delimited or data frame with the compulsory columns:
"CHR", "SNP", "BP", "P", "Trait".}

\item{trait1}{A character string of the trait1 as it appears in the input data.}

\item{trait2}{A character string of the trait2 as it appears in the input data.}

\item{trait1_chromCols}{A character vector indicating which colors to alternate
for trait1 chromosomes.}

\item{trait2_chromCols}{A character vector indicating which colors to alternate
for trait2 chromosomes.}

\item{xlab}{A character string to be used as the x-axis label.}

\item{title}{A character string to be used as the plot title}

\item{annotate_trait1_pval}{If set, trait1 SNPs with p-value less than or equal to this
p-value will be annotated on the plot.}

\item{annotate_trait1_color}{A character string indicating the color to be used for annotating
trait1 SNPs by p-value}

\item{annotate_trait2_pval}{If set, trait2 SNPs with p-value less than or equal to this
p-value will be annotated on the plot.}

\item{annotate_trait2_color}{A character string indicating the color to be used for annotating
trait2 SNPs by p-value}

\item{annotateSNP}{A character vector of SNPs in your dataset to annotate.
If some of the SNPs are not in your dataset, gwaRs will throw a warning message.}

\item{annotateSNPcolor}{A character string denoting the color to use for the annotations.}

\item{highlight}{A character vector of SNPs in the dataset to highlight.
If some of the SNPs are not in your dataset, gwaRs will throw a warning message. Default is NULL.}

\item{highlightcolor}{A character string denoting the color to use to highlight the SNPs.}

\item{genomewideline_trait1}{Where to draw the "genome-wide significant" line for trait1}

\item{genomewideline_trait2}{Where to draw the "genome-wide significant" line for trait2}

\item{genomewideline_type}{A character string denoting the type of line to be used for the
"genome-wide significant" line. This is the same for both traits. Default is dashed.}

\item{genomewideline_color}{A character string denoting the color to be used for the
"genome-wide significant" line. This is the same for both traits. Default is red.}

\item{suggestiveline_trait1}{Where to draw the "suggestive" line for trait1.}

\item{suggestiveline_trait2}{Where to draw the "suggestive" line for trait2.}

\item{suggestiveline_type}{A character string denoting the type of line to be used for the
"suggestive" line. This is the same for both traits. Default is dashed}

\item{suggestiveline_color}{A character string denoting the color to be used for the
"suggestive" line. This is the same for both traits. Default is blue.}
